At CodeClan week 5 is project week so I decided to go with the shop brief: make a web application to be used by shop manager/owner/staff to keep track of their
inventory. As I have recently set-up a small record label (which will be selling vinyl, t-shirts, and other merch) I hope that I personally will be able to use
my own purpose built application in the near future.

FRIDAY
After spending some time considering my project with instructors and fellow cohorts, I eventually decided to scrap my initial idea and go with a straight-forward
idea that fits the brief 100%. I used the requirements for the PDA submission as a checklist for my planning; including wireframes, use case and activity
diagrams, and class/object/sql_schema diagrams.

SATURDAY
Basically had a day off, however I did create a basic file structure, a database, and looked at previous examples and documentation.

SUNDAY
Completed database set-up with sql schema, ran tests on my models.
